# Honeycomb Kubernetes Agent

[Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io) is built for modern dev teams to see and understand how their production systems are 
behaving. Our goal is to give engineers the observability they need to eliminate toil and delight their users.
This helm chart will install the [Honeycomb Kubernetes Agent](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeycomb-kubernetes-agent).

## TL;DR;
```bash
helm repo add honeycomb https://honeycombio.github.io/helm-charts
helm install honeycomb honeycomb/honeycomb --set honeycomb.apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Prerequisites
- Helm 3.0+

## Installing the Chart
### Using default agent configuration
By default, this chart will collect metrics from all nodes and pods, and watchers configuration to capture logs from the following system components:
- kube-controller-manager
- kube-scheduler
```bash
helm repo add honeycomb https://honeycombio.github.io/helm-charts
helm install honeycomb honeycomb/honeycomb --set honeycomb.apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Using modified log watchers configuration
The agent watchers can be configured via this chart's `watchers` property. Create a yaml file with your
Honeycomb API key and custom agent configuration similar to the following:
```yaml
honeycomb:
  apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY
watchers:
  - dataset: kubernetes-logs
    labelSelector: component=kube-controller-manager
    namespace: kube-system
    parser: glog
  - dataset: kubernetes-logs
    labelSelector: component=kube-scheduler
    namespace: kube-system
    parser: glog
```
Then use this yaml file when installing the chart
```bash
helm repo add honeycomb https://honeycombio.github.io/helm-charts
helm install honeycomb honeycomb/honeycomb --values my-values-file.yaml
```

### Capturing events with Heptio Eventrouter
An optional configuration is to capture Kubernetes events using the 
[Heptio Eventrouter](https://github.com/heptiolabs/eventrouter) component.
Configure the Eventrouter to use the `stdout` sink for logs, and you can capture them
with this watchers configuration  
```yaml
watchers:
  - dataset: k8s-eventrouter
    labelSelector: app=eventrouter
    namespace: olly
    parser: json
    processors:
      - drop_field:
          field: old_event
```

See [docs](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeycomb-kubernetes-agent/blob/master/docs/configuration-reference.md) for more information on agent watchers configuration.

## Configuration

The [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file contains information about all configuration
options for this chart.

The only requirement is a Honeycomb API Key. This can be provided either by setting `honeycomb.apiKey` or by setting `honeycomb.existingSecret` to the name of an existing opaque secret resource with your API Key specified in the `honeycomb.existingSecretKey` value.

You can obtain your API Key by going to your Account profile page inside of your Honeycomb instance.

## Parameters

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Honeycomb chart, and their default values.

## Upgrading

### Upgrading from 1.0.x or earlier
The default log collection now includes all standard Kubernetes services. 
The following Kubernetes components will have logs collection enabled by default: 
api-server, controller, scheduler, coredns, kube-proxy. 
You can override this using the `watchers` parameter.

### Upgrading from 0.11.0 or earlier

The `agent.` prefix for properties has been deprecated. 
All properties under this space have been moved to the root level. 
In a future release the `agent.` prefix will no longer work for any property.

The Metrics functionality has been completely revamped. No more dependencies on external
components (heapster). As such the default dataset has changed, and other properties
associated with metrics are updated.

The Events functionality has been removed in favor of using the Heptio event router.
