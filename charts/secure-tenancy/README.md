# Honeycomb Secure Tenancy Proxy

[Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io) is built for modern dev teams to see and understand how their production systems are
behaving. Our goal is to give engineers the observability they need to eliminate toil and delight their users.
This helm chart will install the [Honeycomb Secure Tenancy Proxy](https://docs.honeycomb.io/authentication-and-security/secure-tenancy/).

## Prerequisites
- Helm 3.0+

## Preparing to install chart
### Enable Secure Tenancy in Honeycomb
Before installing this chart you will need to have Secure Tenancy enabled for your Honeycomb team. You will need to contact Honeycomb customer support or your account representative to have the functionality enabled.

### Building Image
Honeycomb will provide you with a tarball for Secure Tenancy. You will need to build the image using the provided [Dockerfile](./resources/Dockerfile). Copy the Secure Tenancy tarball into the same folder as the Dockerfile as `secure-tenancy.tbz` then run the following replacing YOUR_REPOSITORY accordingly:

```bash
docker build -t YOUR_REPOSITORY/honeycomb/secure-tenancy .
docker push YOUR_REPOSITORY/honeycomb/secure-tenancy
```

## Installing the chart
### Simple install (recommended for testing)
This will install the Secure Tenancy proxy, and a MySQL database using the Bitnami MariaDB chart.
A job to migrate and initialize the database will also be run as a post-install hook.
Since the job requires the MySQL database to be up and running, the Helm install command below may not return for up to
3 minutes.
```bash
helm repo add honeycomb https://honeycombio.github.io/helm-charts
helm install secure-tenancy honeycomb/secure-tenancy \
    --set honeycomb.authToken=YOUR_SECURE_TENANCY_TOKEN \
    --set image.repository=YOUR_REPOSITORY/honeycomb/secure-tenancy
```

### Advanced install (recommended for production)
It's recommended to use a Helm values file to install this chart. The `honeycomb.authToken` and `image.repository` parameters are required.
When used in a production environment a MySQL database is typically provided.
You will need to set `mysql.enabled` to false, and `mysql.existingHost` to the host and port of the provided database.
All parameters, including those used for database credentials are described in the [Parameters](#parameters) section.
A typical installation values file may look like the following:
```yaml
honeycomb:
  authToken: YOUR_SECURE_TENANCY_TOKEN

image:
  repository: YOUR_REPOSITORY/honeycomb/secure-tenancy

metrics:
  apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY
  dataset: secure-tenancy-metrics

mysql:
  enabled: false
  existingHost: mysql.mysql:3306
  db:
    # MySQL user
    user: hny-secure-tenancy
    # MySQL password
    password: db_password
    # MySQL database
    name: hny-secure-tenancy
```

After the Helm values file is created, you can install the chart
```bash
helm repo add honeycomb https://honeycombio.github.io/helm-charts
helm install secure-tenancy honeycomb/secure-tenancy --values my-values.yaml
```

## Parameters

## Template Manifest
It may be desired to have Helm render Kubernetes manifests but not have them installed.
You can use the `helm template` command to accomplish this.
By default, the output Kubernetes manifests will contain Helm specific annotations.
You can remove these from the output templates by setting a special `omitHelm` parameter to false when generating the templates.

## Upgrading

### Upgrading from 0.1.4 or earlier
Support for stable Kubernetes was added. If you are deploying to a cluster that is Kubernetes version 1.19 or greater
this will leverage the stable version for Ingress. With the stable version, each path definition will use
`pathType: Prefix` which means the path itself can not contain any wildcards. If you previously had this set to `/*` or
similar, you will need to update your path to remove the wildcard.
