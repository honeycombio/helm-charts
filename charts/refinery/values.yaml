# Refinery rules.
# This section allows configuring Refinery rules.

# It is highly recommend to set your own rules.
# When using the operators `>`, `>=` or `!=`, indicate that they are strings by enclosing them in single quotes, like ('>=').
# See https://docs.honeycomb.io/manage-data-volume/refinery/sampling-methods/ for how to configure Refinery rules.

## Scaling Refinery ##
#
# Since Refinery is a stateful service we recommend provisioning refinery
# for your anticipated peak load and using Stress Relief to minimize impact
# from changes in cluster membership.

# Use replicaCount and resource limits to set the size of your Refinery cluster
# per your anticipated peak load.
# replicaCount is ignored if autoscaling is enabled
