# Refinery rules.
# This section allows configuring Refinery rules.
# The default value is the bare minimum Refinery requires in order to run.
# It is highly recommend to set your own rules.
# When using the operators `>`, `>=` or `!=`, indicate that they are strings by enclosing them in single quotes, like ('>=').
# See https://docs.honeycomb.io/manage-data-volume/refinery/sampling-methods/ for how to configure Refinery rules.

## Scaling Refinery ##
#
# If you are not using autoscaling we recommend provisioning refinery
# for your anticipated peak load and using Stress Relief to minimize impact
# from changes in cluster membership.
#
# Use replicaCount and resource limits to set the size of your Refinery cluster
# per your anticipated peak load. Refinery now performs better with many smaller
# instances instead of a few big instances.
# replicaCount is ignored if autoscaling is enabled
